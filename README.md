# Application Tracker

A backend application for managing job applications built with **Spring Boot**, **JWT authentication**, and **PostgreSQL** — designed as a production-ready REST API and deployed using **AWS EC2 and RDS**.

This project demonstrates secure authentication, RESTful design, and real-world cloud deployment, making it ideal for entry-level backend / full-stack roles.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Job searching often involves tracking multiple applications, companies, roles, and statuses. **Application Tracker** provides a secure backend API that allows users to:

- Register and authenticate using JWT
- Create, read, update, and delete job applications
- Store data persistently using PostgreSQL
- Run locally or in the cloud using AWS infrastructure

This project is backend-only and can be paired with a frontend (React, Angular, etc.) in the future.
